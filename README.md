### Reflections and Comments

* I was not able to complete the styling of the entire page in 2 hours but I have submitted what was completed.  I also attached an image of the design/mock-up that I worked on before I started to create css.
* I struggled with the first logo image and text.  I couldn't get them to stack on each other.  I thought you used the flex direction: column for it but could not get that too work. Also, adding the border, I wasn't sure how to get the design used on the design specs.
